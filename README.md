# AppointmentScheduler
A java appointment scheduler application that uses a MySQL relational database to add/update/delete appointments and customers.
Although these are not real patients or appointments, this type of data is sensitive so a login screen was added to ensure the 
safety of the information that would exist in an application like this one.
Username and password are "test".
